This is a demo app for IMANOMU.
It is made for the store and can manage the seat.

- You can change the seat status to

           - vacan
           - fill
           - accounting
           - check
     
- Please try to tap the seat. You do not need explanation
- I'm going to see my seat time every 5 minutes
- It will tell you a few minutes to stay.
